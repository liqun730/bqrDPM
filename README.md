# bqrDPM
Bayesian quantile regression based on Dirichlet process mixtures (DPM). Specifically, we implement the following models:
* DPM of the logistic distributions. This is our proposed and recommended model.
* DPM of the uniform distribution.
* DPM of normal densities.
* DPM of mixture of two normal densities.
* DPM of Asymmetric Laplacian Distribution (ALD).
* Bayesian quantile regression using ALD as the likelihood.
* Some other methods.
